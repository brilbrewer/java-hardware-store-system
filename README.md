Java Hardware Store System
Overview

The Java Hardware Store System is a console-based Java application designed to simulate core operations of a hardware store. This project demonstrates object-oriented programming principles, file handling, and modular program design in Java.

The system manages store inventory, staff scheduling, and operational workflows using clean, organized code.
